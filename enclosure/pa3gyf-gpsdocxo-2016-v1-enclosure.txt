	- I built the V1 with a Velleman aluminium enclosure; I used them a lot in the past,
	    and still own half a dozen or so boxes hosting projects or in the spare-parts section.
	- Unfortunately, it seems that Velleman no longer (2019) sells this line of enclosures.
	- I have a hard time figuring out the part number, but reasonably close is:
		Velleman L750 - METAL HOUSING CASSETTE - 80 x 200 x 132mm 
		from https://www.velleman.eu/products/view/?country=nl&lang=en&id=11247
		with dimensions (A x B x C): 80 x 200 x 132mm (-> H x W x D),
		except that the dimensions are different.
	- Looks like we have a unit from this series, but with different dimensions.
