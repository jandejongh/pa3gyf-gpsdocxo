# pa3gyf-gpsdocxo
GPS-Disciplined OCXO (In Progress)

After (a.o.) G3RUH and G4HUP, with PA3GYF additions for monitoring GPS (FIX) status, extra isolation of the (sine) output signals from the PLL, monitoring OCXO heater, monitoring PLL LOCK status, manual frequency tuning (stand-alone OCXO) and stand-alone GPS operation.
Includes front and rear panel designs (Schaeffer Front-Panel Designer) and Arduino firmware.

I'm currently integrating and testing the various components, and expect to release more details by the end of 2016 (that is, the expected moment I will have removed all too-embarrassing remnants...).
